# Dart TUI Framework

## Project Overview

The Dart TUI (Text User Interface) Framework is designed to help developers create interactive and customizable terminal-based user interfaces using Dart. It provides components such as text fields, checkboxes, and buttons, along with utilities to render text in various styles, colors, and positions. This framework is ideal for building console-based applications that need dynamic input handling, customizable styles, and interactive elements.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Components**: Includes components like `Checkbox`, `TextField`, and more.
- **Customizable Styles**: Allows you to customize text appearance with foreground and background colors, padding, and more.
- **Terminal Control**: Fullscreen mode, clearing the screen after delays, and centered text display.
- **Event Handling**: Supports keyboard input handling and custom event actions for interactive components.
- **Built for Dart**: Native Dart support without the need for external dependencies.
